# clocky
Ionic, Angular, lots of CSS, purely experimental. I built this because I wasn't familiar with how Ionic animations and dynamic scss variables worked. Well, now I am and you can too. This is just a clock with some minimal/pretty animations. Day and night cycles somewhat included. Feel free to poke around. Test (download) it [here](https://github.com/pslyman/clocky/tree/master/app-signed). Can be built into an APK if desired.

### clone respositry, then:

###### npm install
###### ionic serve
